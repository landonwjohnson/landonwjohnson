## üëã Hello! I'm Landon Johnson
I'm a passionate developer who enjoys creating tools and content and engaging with the community. I embrace failing fast, iterating quickly, and constantly seeking growth. Programming is more than just a job for me‚Äîit's a way to give back. My hobbies frequently involve computers, where I'm always building on or branching off from the skills I've already developed. 

### NPM Packages
Explore the NPM packages I've built and designed for seamless integration and reliable performance. I promote DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and improve project code reuse and efficiency.

These packages are primarily for personal use, helping me manage shared code across multiple projects. I intend to avoid going big with these packages or significantly contributing to the community; it's about preventing repetition and saving time. I've always been fascinated by NPM packages. While the documentation is minimal, I've made it available for others who want to learn or see my process.

By packaging code, I ensure consistency and efficiency across my work, especially in environments where comprehensive testing is only sometimes in place. My projects might be flawed, but they are not supposed to meet my needs and help maintain productivity. If the idea were solid and fun, I would be interested in collaborating with other people to build a meaningful NPM package.

## ‚ö° Skills I'm Currently Learning for fun:
<sub> 
I've been exploring SwiftUI, StyleXJS, and **Google App Script** in my spare time for fun. After working with React Native, I found it essential to understand the native code behind cross-platform frameworks like SwiftUI. While cross-platform solutions are helpful depending on project needs, I enjoy the efficiency of sharing a single codebase across platforms, which I've been doing with React Native using Atomic Design Patterns for iOS, Android, tvOS, Xbox, and more. Although native code is unbeatable, I plan to learn more Swift and Kotlin in the future without overextending myself.
I've also been trying out StyleXJS from Meta. It's more user-friendly for cross-platform development and code sharing, so it caught my attention.
Lastly, I'm learning Google App Script to build web applications and add-ons for personal projects. It's been a rewarding experience so far.

## üîç What I'm Looking For:

- More collaborators to work with.
- Remote job opportunities.

## üì¢ Connect with Me on Social Media:

- [YouTube Channel](https://bit.ly/47otldB)

## üèÜ Wakatime Stats

<sub> Please note that these stats only reflect public repositories and do not include private repos. Most of the public repositories on my profile are intended to be something other than showcase pieces. The personal code representing my work is kept private because it involves apps in production or live websites where privacy is crucial. The public repositories on my profile do not showcase my best work as a developer. However, I plan to share code that eventually meets my standards. Also, remember that the stats are not entirely accurate‚ÄîI've done much more TypeScript than JavaScript, along with significantly more PHP, Python, and Swift. </sub>

I'd love to hear your ideas, suggestions, or even just a friendly hello! üöÄ The best way to get my attention is by commenting on my YouTube videos‚Äîyour input means a lot to me and I always look forward to engaging with you there!
