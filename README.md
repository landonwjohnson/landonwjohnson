## üëã Hello! I'm Landon Johnson

<sub>I am a <strong> Fullstack Developer </strong> driven by rapid iteration and a commitment to continuous growth. For me, programming is not just a profession‚Äîit's a way to contribute and share knowledge with others. My journey began as a <strong> Computer Technician </strong>, where I diagnosed and troubleshooted computers remotely. I later ventured into <strong> Design and Motion Graphics </strong> before making a professional shift to software development. Interestingly, these passions have always been a part of my life, whether it was dismantling computers, starting new projects, or creating animations‚Äîlong before they became my career.</sub>  

<sub>Just to clarify, <strong> I'm only available for Software Engineering roles </strong>. </sub> 


<sub>I love building things, and Software Engineering excites me because it empowers you to bring any idea to life. My hobbies revolve around computers, where I am constantly honing my skills. I'm dedicated to lifelong learning and aspire to inspire others to do the same.</sub>

### NPM Packages

<sub>These packages are for personal use, helping me manage shared code across projects to save time and avoid repetition. They are practical tools to meet my needs‚Äîthey're not designed to have catchy names or groundbreaking ideas. They're stepping stones and enjoyable <strong>learning projects created to maintain productivity. </strong> </sub>

## ‚ö° Skills I'm Currently Learning:

<sub>I've been exploring <strong>SwiftUI</strong>, <strong>[StorybookJS](https://bit.ly/storybookjs-redirect-github-readme)</strong>, <strong>[Expo Router](https://bit.ly/expo-router-redirect-github-readme)</strong>, <strong>[React Native Web](https://bit.ly/react-native-web-redirect-from-github-readme)</strong>, <strong>[StyleXJS](https://bit.ly/stylejsx-from-githubreadme)</strong>, and <strong>[Google App Script](https://bit.ly/google-app-scripts-redirect-from-github-readme)</strong> in my spare time. After working with <strong>React Native</strong>, I've focused on understanding the native code behind cross-platform frameworks like <strong>SwiftUI</strong>. I recognize that while one codebase for multiple platforms is appealing, programming individually for each platform offers better control and performance. I use <strong>React Native</strong> with <strong>[Atomic Design Patterns](https://bit.ly/atomic-design-redirect-from-github-readme)
</strong> to ensure a consistent user experience across <strong>iOS</strong>, <strong>Android</strong>, <strong>Web</strong>, <strong>[tvOS](https://bit.ly/react-native-tv-os-redirect-from-github-readme)</strong>, <strong>[Android TV](https://bit.ly/react-native-tv-os-redirect-from-github-readme)</strong> and <strong>[Xbox](https://bit.ly/react-native-windows-redirect-github-readme).</strong></sub>  
<br />
<sub>I've also been experimenting with <strong>StyleXJS</strong> from Meta for its user-friendly approach to <strong>cross-platform development</strong>. Additionally, I'm learning <strong>Google App Script</strong> to build <strong>Web Applications</strong> and <strong>add-ons</strong> for personal projects. </sub>

## üîç What I'm Looking For:

- More collaborators to work with.
- Remote job opportunities.

## üèÜ Wakatime Stats
<sub>These stats only reflect public repositories and exclude private ones. Most of my personal code is kept private due to its involvement in production apps or live websites. The public repositories do not represent my best work, but I plan to share code that meets my standards eventually. The stats also don't accurately reflect my experience, especially in TypeScript, PHP, Python, and Swift.</sub>

<sub>I'd love to hear your ideas, suggestions, or even just a friendly hello! üöÄ The best way to get my attention is by commenting on my YouTube videos‚Äîyour input means a lot to me and I always look forward to engaging with you there!</sub>
