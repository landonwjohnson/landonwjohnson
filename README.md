## üëã Hello! I'm Landon Johnson
<sub>
I am a Fullstack Developer who thrives on rapid iteration and continuous growth. Programming is more than a profession‚Äîit's a means to contribute and share knowledge. My journey began as a Computer Technician, diagnosing and troubleshooting computers remotely. I then moved into design and motion graphics before transitioning to software development professionally. Interestingly, I've always pursued these passions outside of work, whether dismantling computers, starting new projects, or creating animations as a teenager, long before they became part of my career.

I love building things, and Software Engineering excites me because it empowers you to bring any idea to life. My hobbies revolve around computers, where I am constantly honing my skills. I'm dedicated to lifelong learning and aspire to inspire others to do the same.

### NPM Packages

<sub>These packages are for personal use, helping me manage shared code across projects to save time and avoid repetition. They are practical tools to meet my needs‚Äîthey're not designed to have catchy names or groundbreaking ideas. They're stepping stones and enjoyable learning projects created to maintain productivity. </sub>

## ‚ö° Skills I'm Currently Learning:
<sub>
I've been exploring SwiftUI, StorybookJS, React Native Web, StyleXJS, and Google App Script in my spare time. After working with React Native, I've focused on understanding the native code behind cross-platform frameworks like SwiftUI. I recognize that while one codebase for multiple platforms is appealing, programming individually for each platform offers better control and performance. I use React Native with Atomic Design Patterns to ensure a consistent user experience across iOS, Android, Web, tvOS, AndroidTV and Xbox.</sub>

<sub>I've also been experimenting with StyleXJS from Meta for its user-friendly approach to cross-platform development. Additionally, I'm learning Google App Script to build web applications and add-ons for personal projects. </sub>

## üîç What I'm Looking For:

- More collaborators to work with.
- Remote job opportunities.

## üì¢ Connect with Me on Social Media:

- [YouTube Channel](https://bit.ly/47otldB)

## üèÜ Wakatime Stats
<sub>These stats only reflect public repositories and exclude private ones. Most of my personal code is kept private due to its involvement in production apps or live websites. The public repositories do not represent my best work, but I plan to share code that meets my standards eventually. The stats also don't accurately reflect my experience, especially in TypeScript, PHP, Python, and Swift.</sub>

<sub>I'd love to hear your ideas, suggestions, or even just a friendly hello! üöÄ The best way to get my attention is by commenting on my YouTube videos‚Äîyour input means a lot to me and I always look forward to engaging with you there!</sub>
